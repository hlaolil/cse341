## üéØ **WHY THIS FIXES THE FEEDBACK:**

### ‚úÖ **PUT Operation Clearly Demonstrated:**

- Shows the PUT request being executed
- Shows Status 204 response
- Verifies the update by getting the contact again
- Shows actual data change (VideoDemo ‚Üí UPDATED)

### ‚úÖ **DELETE Operation Clearly Demonstrated:**

- Shows the DELETE request being executed
- Shows Status 200 response
- Verifies deletion by showing 404 when trying to get the deleted contact

### ‚úÖ **Uses Same Contact for Both:**

- Creates one contact with POST
- Updates it with PUT
- Deletes it with DELETE
- Shows complete lifecycle

### ‚úÖ **Clear Status Codes:**

- POST: 201 (Created)
- GET: 200 (OK)
- PUT: 204 (No Content)
- DELETE: 200 (OK)
- GET deleted: 404 (Not Found)

## üèÜ **PROFESSOR WILL SEE:**

1. **Clear PUT demonstration** with before/after verification
2. **Clear DELETE demonstration** with verification
3. **Proper status codes** for all operations
4. **Database interaction** (create ‚Üí update ‚Üí delete)
5. **Deployed Render API** (not localhost)

**This directly addresses the missing PUT and DELETE feedback!** üéØ
