# W5 Final Project Part 1: Music API Video Demo Guide

**Duration: 5-8 minutes**

## Video Outline and Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Show VS Code with project structure]**

"Hello! In this video, I'll demonstrate how I've implemented the Week 5 Final Project requirements for my Music API. This project includes two collections - Artists and Albums - with full CRUD operations, comprehensive error handling, and professional API documentation deployed on Render."

### Project Overview (45 seconds)

**[Show file structure in VS Code]**

"Let me start by showing you the project structure. This is my Music API with:

- **Two Collections**: Artists and Albums with full relationships
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for both collections
- **Authentication**: OAuth implementation for protected endpoints
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error responses
- **Deployment**: Live on Render with accessible API docs"

### 1. Database Collections & Models (60 seconds)

**[Show database schema and sample data]**

"First, let's look at our two main collections:

**Artists Collection** contains:

- Name, genre, country, formed year
- Array of band members
- Biography, website, social media links
- Created/updated timestamps

**Albums Collection** contains:

- Title, artist reference (relationship), release date
- Genre, track count, duration
- Record label, cover image URL
- Created/updated timestamps

The collections have a one-to-many relationship where one artist can have multiple albums."

### 2. CRUD Operations Demo (2.5 minutes)

#### Artists CRUD (75 seconds)

**[Use api-tests.rest file or Postman]**

"Let me demonstrate all CRUD operations for Artists:

**GET /artists** - Retrieve all artists with pagination and filtering

- Show basic GET request
- Demonstrate filtering by genre: `?genre=Rock`
- Show pagination: `?page=1&limit=5`
- Display the paginated response structure

**POST /artists** - Create a new artist

- Show valid POST request with all required fields
- Demonstrate validation by sending invalid data (missing name)
- Show 400 error response with detailed validation messages
- Create successful artist and show 201 response

**GET /artists/:id** - Get specific artist

- Show successful retrieval with valid ObjectId
- Demonstrate 400 error with invalid ID format
- Show 404 error with non-existent ID

**PUT /artists/:id** - Update artist

- Show successful update with 204 response
- Demonstrate validation errors

**DELETE /artists/:id** - Delete artist

- Show successful deletion
- Demonstrate cascading validation (cannot delete artist with albums)"

#### Albums CRUD (75 seconds)

**[Continue with API testing]**

"Now for Albums CRUD operations:

**GET /albums** - Retrieve all albums

- Show basic request and response
- Demonstrate filtering: `?genre=Rock&year=1971`
- Show sorting: `?sortBy=release_date&sortOrder=desc`

**POST /albums** - Create new album

- Show valid POST with artist relationship
- Demonstrate validation (invalid artist_id returns 400)
- Show duplicate prevention (same title for same artist)
- Display successful creation with full album data

**GET /albums/artist/:artistId** - Get albums by artist

- Show relationship queries working correctly

**PUT /albums/:id** and **DELETE /albums/:id**

- Demonstrate successful updates and deletions
- Show proper error handling for invalid IDs"

### 3. Error Handling & Validation (60 seconds)

**[Show various error scenarios]**

"Let me showcase our comprehensive error handling:

**Validation Errors (400)**:

- Missing required fields
- Invalid data types (string instead of number)
- Invalid date formats
- Invalid URLs
- Field length restrictions

**Authentication Errors (401)**:

- Protected POST, PUT, DELETE require authentication

**Conflict Errors (409)**:

- Duplicate artist names
- Duplicate album titles for same artist

**Not Found Errors (404)**:

- Invalid resource IDs

**Server Errors (500)**:

- Database connection issues
- Unexpected server errors

Each error includes:

- Proper HTTP status code
- Clear error message
- Detailed validation feedback when applicable"

### 4. API Documentation (60 seconds)

**[Show Swagger/OpenAPI documentation]**

"Our API includes comprehensive Swagger documentation:

**Live Documentation**: Available at `/api-docs`

- All endpoints documented with parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Error code definitions
- Interactive testing interface

**Features shown**:

- Complete endpoint listings for both collections
- Authentication requirements clearly marked
- Request body schemas with validation rules
- Response examples for success and error cases
- Parameter descriptions and constraints

The documentation is deployed live on Render and fully functional for testing."

### 5. Deployment & Production Ready (45 seconds)

**[Show deployed application]**

"The API is deployed on Render at [your-render-url]:

**Production Features**:

- Environment-based configuration
- Secure OAuth authentication
- MongoDB Atlas database connection
- CORS properly configured
- Error logging and monitoring
- API documentation accessible at `/api-docs`

**Testing the live API**:

- Show GET request to live URL
- Demonstrate Swagger UI working in production
- Verify all endpoints are accessible"

### Individual Contributions (30 seconds)

**[Show specific code sections]**

"My individual contributions for this week include:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive validation with detailed error messages for both collections
2. **Advanced Filtering & Pagination**: Added query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination on GET endpoints
3. **Relationship Validation**: Added checks to prevent data inconsistencies (e.g., deleting artists with albums)
4. **Comprehensive API Testing**: Created extensive test suite covering all endpoints and error scenarios
5. **Professional Documentation**: Updated Swagger documentation with all new features and error codes"

### Conclusion (15 seconds)

**[Show final project structure]**

"This completes my Week 5 Final Project demonstration. The Music API includes two fully functional collections with complete CRUD operations, robust error handling, comprehensive documentation, and is deployed live on Render. The API is ready for production use and meets all project requirements."

## Preparation Checklist for Video Recording

### Before Recording:

- [ ] Ensure API is deployed and working on Render
- [ ] Test all endpoints in api-tests.rest file
- [ ] Verify Swagger documentation is accessible
- [ ] Have sample data seeded in database
- [ ] Prepare VS Code with relevant files open
- [ ] Test microphone and screen recording quality
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications/tabs

### Files to Show:

- [ ] `server.js` - Main application setup
