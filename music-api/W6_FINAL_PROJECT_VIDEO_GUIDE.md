## üìã Video Demonstration Plan (8-10 minutes total)

### Section 1: Project Overview (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- **File Structure**: Show the complete project structure in VS Code
- **Collections**: "We now have four complete collections: Artists, Albums, Songs, and Playlists"
- **Technology Stack**: Express.js, MongoDB, OAuth, Jest testing, Swagger documentation

**Script:**
"Let's start with our project structure. You can see we have a complete Music API with four collections. Our routes directory contains artists.js, albums.js, songs.js, and playlists.js. We have OAuth authentication in our middleware, comprehensive unit tests in our tests directory, and complete API documentation via Swagger."

### Section 2: New Collections Demo (2 minutes)

#### Songs Collection

**API Endpoints to Demo:**

```
GET /songs (with filtering)
GET /songs/:id
POST /songs (show OAuth security)
PUT /songs/:id (show validation)
DELETE /songs/:id
```

**What to Show:**

- Open Postman/REST client
- Demo GET `/songs` endpoint with filtering: `?genre=rock&artist_id=ARTIST_ID`
- Demo GET `/songs/:id` for individual song
- Show POST `/songs` **WITH OAUTH** - demonstrate authentication requirement
- Show PUT `/songs/:id` with validation errors
- Show successful song creation and update

**Script:**
"The Songs collection manages individual tracks. Notice how songs require both artist_id and album_id for proper relationships. Let me demonstrate the OAuth security - watch what happens when I try to POST without authentication... [show 401 error]. Now with authentication... [show success]."

#### Playlists Collection

**API Endpoints to Demo:**

```
GET /playlists
GET /playlists/:id/songs (special endpoint)
POST /playlists (show OAuth security)
PUT /playlists/:id/songs (add songs to playlist)
DELETE /playlists/:id
```

**What to Show:**

- Demo GET `/playlists` with filtering
- Demo the special GET `/playlists/:id/songs` endpoint showing playlist contents
- Show POST `/playlists` **WITH OAUTH** - demonstrate authentication requirement
- Show adding songs to playlist
- Demo validation errors and success responses

**Script:**
"Playlists are our most complex collection. They can contain multiple songs and have a special endpoint for viewing playlist contents. Notice the OAuth protection on write operations and comprehensive validation of song references."

### Section 3: Enhanced Validation Demo (1.5 minutes)

**What to Show:**

- **All Four Collections**: Demonstrate validation on POST/PUT for each collection
- **Required Fields**: Show missing required field errors
- **Data Types**: Show invalid data type errors
- **Relationships**: Show invalid artist_id or album_id references
- **Success Cases**: Show proper validation passing

**Validation Examples to Demo:**

```javascript
// Artists - Missing required field
POST /artists
{
  "name": "Test Artist"
  // Missing genre, country, formed_year, members
}

// Albums - Invalid artist_id reference
POST /albums
{
  "title": "Test Album",
  "artist_id": "invalid-id",
  // etc.
}

// Songs - Invalid relationship references
POST /songs
{
  "title": "Test Song",
  "artist_id": "nonexistent-artist-id",
  "album_id": "nonexistent-album-id"
  // etc.
}

// Playlists - Invalid song references
POST /playlists
{
  "name": "Test Playlist",
  "creator_name": "Test Creator",
  "songs": ["nonexistent-song-id"]
}
```

**Script:**
"Let me demonstrate the comprehensive validation system. Watch what happens when I send invalid data... [show validation errors]. Notice how the errors are specific and helpful for debugging. Now let me show successful validation... [show success responses]."

### Section 4: OAuth Security Implementation (1.5 minutes)

**What to Show:**

- **Authentication Check**: Demo hitting secured endpoints without auth (401 errors)
- **Login Process**: Show `/auth/login` and `/auth/profile` endpoints
- **Protected Operations**: Demo successful POST/PUT with authentication
- **Security Coverage**: Explain which operations are protected

**Protected Endpoints to Demo:**

```
POST /artists (protected)
PUT /artists/:id (protected)
POST /albums (protected)
PUT /albums/:id (protected)
POST /songs (protected)
PUT /songs/:id (protected)
POST /playlists (protected)
PUT /playlists/:id (protected)
```

**Script:**
"Security is crucial for our API. All POST and PUT operations are protected by OAuth. Let me show you the authentication system... [demo /auth/login]. Now watch the difference between authenticated and unauthenticated requests... [demo both scenarios]."

### Section 5: Unit Testing Coverage (2 minutes)

**What to Show:**

- Open terminal in VS Code
- Run `npm test` to show all tests
- Explain test coverage: 4+ tests per collection
- Show individual test files
- Demonstrate test results

**Test Files to Show:**

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testSetup.js (MongoDB Memory Server setup)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artists.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ albums.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ songs.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playlists.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
```

**Terminal Commands:**

```bash
npm test
# Show results: 16+ tests passing

# Optional: Show individual test file
npm test -- artists.test.js
```

**Script:**
"Testing is essential for reliable APIs. I've created comprehensive unit tests for all GET endpoints across all four collections. Let me run the test suite... [run npm test]. You can see we have 16+ tests covering various scenarios including filtering, pagination, error cases, and successful responses."

### Section 6: API Documentation (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- Open Swagger UI (if deployed) or show swagger.json file
- Navigate through all four collections
- Show comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Demonstrate API version 2.0.0 with all collections

**Script:**
"Professional APIs need comprehensive documentation. Our Swagger documentation covers all four collections with detailed schemas, examples, and response codes. You can see we've upgraded to API version 2.0.0 to reflect our expanded functionality."

### Section 7: Live API Testing (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- **Production URL**: Use the actual deployed Render URL
- **Complete Workflow**: Create Artist ‚Üí Create Album ‚Üí Create Song ‚Üí Create Playlist
- **Relationship Testing**: Show how data relationships work
- **End-to-End Demo**: Complete CRUD cycle

**Script:**
"Let me demonstrate the live production API with a complete workflow. I'll create an artist, then an album for that artist, then songs for the album, and finally a playlist containing those songs. This shows how all our collections work together."
